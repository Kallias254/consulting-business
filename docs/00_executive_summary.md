# 00: Executive Summary - Scientist-as-a-Service

## The Vision
Transition from being a "service provider" (writer/editor) to a **Business Architect**. You are building a "Scientist-as-a-Service" model that solves the highest-friction problems in academic publishing.

## The Core Problem
The "CRC Press Bible" identifies exactly where elite researchers fail:
- Formatting complex equations.
- Managing nested chapter numbering.
- Figure call-outs and high-res placement.
- Reference management (BibTeX/Zotero) across massive manuscripts.

## The "Snappy" Solution
A lean, code-first business model using **Payload CMS 3.0** for operations and **Typst** for production. This allows you to produce publisher-ready PDFs that make your clients look like elite scholars while keeping your overhead near zero.

## Key Stakeholders
- **Micah (The Rainmaker):** US-based academic face of the company. Focuses on networking and referrals.
- **You (The Architect):** Manages the "Engine," reviews output, and automates workflows.
- **Delegated Writers:** External talent writing in Markdown, managed via the Payload portal.

## The Competitive Edge
While competitors use Word or Google Docs, you deliver **Publisher-Ready LaTeX/Typst files**. This means zero extra work for the journal's typesetter, leading to faster acceptance and higher professional prestige for the client.
