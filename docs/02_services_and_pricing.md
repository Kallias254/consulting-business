## The Service Spectrum: Adapt & Improve
Our service tiers are designed to solve specific client problems at different stages of the academic lifecycle, from basic finishing to full-cycle project management.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dossier Ingestion** | Self-managed Word Doc CV. | **The Authority Record:** We ingest your messy CV into our structured database for free. |
| **Editing** | Basic formatting ($0.044/word). | **Technical Development:** Deep structural editing and publisher compliance checks. |
| **Consulting** | Methodology and research design. | **Faculty-Level Peer Review:** Micah’s team reviews work *before* it hits a committee. |
| **Statistics** | Running SPSS, R, Python scripts. | **Data Storytelling:** We don't just run numbers; we write the "Results" section to be publisher-ready. |
| **Coaching** | Mindset, habits, procrastination. | **Strategic Project Management:** Managing the entire timeline of a research grant or paper. |
| **Support** | The service stops at delivery. | **Publication Liaison:** We manage the back-and-forth with journal editors post-submission. |

## Strategic Advantage: The "Leverage" Strategy
Unlike automated services, we use Micah's insight to manage **Simultaneous Submissions**. 
- **The Logic:** Submitting a book proposal to 3-5 relevant houses at once (with disclosure) creates a "soft auction" environment. If one press expresses interest, we can notify the others to accelerate their review.
- **The Safety Net:** It protects the client (and our success fee) from the "all eggs in one basket" syndrome. If one press rejects, we are already in the pipeline elsewhere.

## Competitive Landscape: How We Win

We don't compete with "Editing Factories." Here is how we differ from the standard market players:

| Competitor | Positioning | Where They Fail (Our Opportunity) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wordvice** | Speed and volume (e.g., 24-hour turnaround). | **Purely Transactional:** They edit words, but don't understand the *strategy* of the argument or the publisher's specific politics. |
| **AJE (American Journal Experts)** | Institutional/Corporate authority. Focus on "Resource Center" content. | **Faceless Corporate:** High-priced but lacks the "Principal-to-Principal" faculty connection. They are a vendor, not a partner. |
| **Enago** | Global reach, heavy focus on ESL/Non-native speakers. | **Mass Market:** Their "Technical Review" is often generic. They cannot offer a personal "Liaison" service with a US faculty member. |

**The "Micah" Difference:** We are the only agency where the client's work is overseen by an active US Professor who understands the "hidden curriculum" of the top houses. We aren't just "fixing grammar"; we are **engineering a publication success.**

## Financial Guardrails: Protecting the Agency Margin

With our **75/25 payout model** (where researchers receive 75% of the net project fee), we must maintain strict pricing floors to ensure the agency remains profitable.

1.  **Minimum Project Fee:** $500. Anything lower makes the administrative cost of management higher than the profit.
2.  **The Net Split:** The 75/25 split is calculated *after* payment processing fees (e.g., Stripe/Wise, approx. 3%) and direct project expenses (e.g., specialized software licenses).
3.  **The Platform Fee:** 5% of the agency's 25% is allocated to "Infrastructure & Admin" to cover the cost of the Agency OS and technical management.
4.  **Value-Based Pricing:** We price based on the *result* (e.g., a published paper), not just the time. This allows us to maintain a high "Principal Profit" even with a high researcher payout.
