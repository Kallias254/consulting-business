# 17: Bespoke Scholarly Solutions - Handling the "Un-classifiable"

Some of your highest-value work will come from problems that don't have a name yet. This module defines the process for "Productizing" a unique request.

## 1. The "Discovery-to-Product" Bridge
When a lead comes in through the "Bespoke" diagnostic path:
- **Phase A: The Discovery Sync (15 mins):** You or Micah identify the *core scholarly goal*. (e.g., "I need this data to look like a Scientific American illustration for my NSF keynote.")
- **Phase B: The Scope Definition:** You define the "Bespoke Project" in Payload. You don't sell "hours"; you sell the **Deliverable**.
- **Phase C: The Quote:** Send a custom Stripe or Wise invoice tied to this specific project.

## 2. Common "Bespoke" Scenarios
- **The Grant Rebuttal:** A "Panic" service helping a researcher address harsh reviewer comments with visual data and perfectly typeset responses.
- **Keynote Visuals:** Converting complex research tables into "Elite Presentation" slides or Typst-rendered handouts.
- **Institutional Archive:** Helping a lab lead consolidate 10 years of disparate papers into a single, typeset "Lab Legacy" digital volume.
- **Scientific Illustration Polish:** Cleaning up messy Python/R plots into publisher-ready, high-resolution figures.

## 3. Workflow Integration
Even if the project is bespoke, the **Workflow stays the same**:
1.  **Drafts** go into the Project Folder.
2.  **Communications** happen via the Mantine Activity Feed.
3.  **Final Files** are delivered via the "Deliverables Vault."

## 4. The "Internal Pivot"
If a Bespoke project happens twice (e.g., you do two "Grant Rebuttals"), we move it from "Bespoke" to a **Standard Product** on the website. This is how you organically grow your product menu based on real market demand.
