# 15: Academic Intelligence Reports - Justifying the Retainer

To maintain a high-value monthly retainer, we provide "Academic Intelligence" that a client cannot get from a generic VA or AI. This is delivered via the **Mantine Dashboard**.

## 1. The "Opportunity Matcher"
Instead of the client checking Twitter or mailing lists, we do the scanning.
- **The Input:** We use the client's "Keywords" and "Research Interests" stored in Payload.
- **The Engine:** Automated scans (using your Hub's scraping/RSS logic) for:
    - **Call for Chapters (CFCs):** Relevant to their field (e.g., a new CRC Press handbook).
    - **Collaboration Calls:** High-impact researchers looking for co-authors.
    - **Funding Alerts:** Upcoming deadlines for Fulbright, DAAD, or specific US Grant cycles.
- **The Delivery:** A "Recommended for You" section in their Portal.

## 2. The "Monthly Scholarly Report"
A high-end PDF (rendered via Typst) sent on the 1st of every month.
- **Citation Impact:** A summary of new citations their work has received (Scraped via Google Scholar/Crossref).
- **Portfolio Health:** Analytics on who is visiting their "Impact Portfolio" site (e.g., "3 visits from US University IPs").
- **Pipeline Review:** A summary of their active manuscripts and where they are in the Publication Cycle.
- **Strategic Recommendation:** One "Next Step" advice from Micah (e.g., "This new CFC in [Field] is perfect for your Chapter 4 work").

## 3. High-Stakes Application Support
We provide specialized "Finishing" for elite applications:
- **Fulbright / Prestigious Fellowships:** We don't just "edit"; we format the application to be typographically superior, ensuring it stands out to the selection committee.
- **Narrative Alignment:** Ensuring their "Impact Portfolio" supports the claims they are making in their application.

## 4. Value Justification
By providing these reports, we move from being an "Expense" to being an **"Investment in Career Growth."**
- If we find *one* chapter invitation or *one* citation they missed, the retainer pays for itself for the entire year.
