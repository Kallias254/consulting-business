# 08: Lifecycle Blueprints - Client, Project, & Product

## 1. The Client Lifecycle (The Relationship)
*How a professor moves through your business.*

1.  **Lead (The Connection):** Micah identifies a colleague with a manuscript or grant.
2.  **Onboarding (The Handshake):** Client gets their "Scientist Portal" login.
3.  **Active (The Sprint):** High-intensity work on a specific paper or book.
4.  **Stewardship (The Pivot):** Upon project completion, we offer the **Free Academic Dossier** ingestion as a gift to protect the client's momentum.
5.  **Retainer (The Partner):** Transition to monthly "Career Acceleration" (Grant scanning, site maintenance via the Impact Portfolio).
6.  **Legacy (The Portfolio):** Long-term storage of their research outputs and "Impact Portfolio."

## 2. The Project Lifecycle (The Execution)

1.  **Intake:** Client uploads draft/figures to Payload.
2.  **Assessment:** You/Micah review for complexity.
3.  **Drafting/Editing:** Delegatee works in Markdown.
4.  **The Pivot (Formatting):** You pull the Markdown into the Typst engine.
5.  **Internal QC:** Prismer.AI check and visual proofing.
6.  **Client Review:** Client views the rendered PDF in the Portal.
7.  **Publication Cycle (The "Ghost" Phase):** 
    - This is the "waiting" period where the manuscript is with the journal or publisher (e.g., CRC Press).
    - **Status:** "Under Peer Review" or "Typesetting by Publisher."
    - **Action:** **The Friday Pulse.** Regardless of progress, the system sends an automated status update every Friday at 4:00 PM so the client enters the weekend with peace of mind.
8.  **Final Delivery:** One-click download of the final manuscript once accepted.

## 3. Product Workflows
- **Publication Sprint:** Fast-tracked (1-2 weeks), focused purely on formatting/proofreading.
- **Retainer:** Monthly "check-ins" via the Portal. The **Opportunity Engine** scans for new grants/calls and alerts the client. Continuous maintenance of the **Impact Portfolio**.
- **Legacy Book:** Multi-month project with "Milestone" payments tied to chapter completions.
