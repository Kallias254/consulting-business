# 10: Status & Anxiety Management - The "No-Black-Hole" Protocol

## The Problem: The "Black Hole" of Publishing
Academic publishing has long "silent" periods. If the client doesn't hear from you, they assume nothing is happening.

## 1. The Dashboard Status Bar
Instead of 20 emails asking "Where are we?", the Payload Portal has a **Real-Time Status Bar**:
- **Status: "Formatting Equations"** (Active work by you).
- **Status: "With Peer Reviewers"** (Waiting on the journal).
- **Status: "Writer Finalizing Bibliography"** (Active work by delegatee).

## 2. The Email Protocol
To reduce confusion between you and Micah:
- **Rule 1: No "Blind" CCs.** Every email to a client must CC the project-specific inbox (e.g., `proj-123@vault.com`). This ensures the email is logged in the Payload Dashboard automatically.
- **Rule 2: The "Portal First" Policy.** If a client emails a question, we answer it in the **Portal Chat** and send them a link. This trains them to use the dashboard as the "Single Source of Truth."

## 3. Automation for Peace of Mind
- **The "Friday Pulse":** Every Friday at 4 PM, Payload sends an automated summary email to the client: *"Here is your weekly summary. We are currently in Phase 3. No action required from you."*
- **The "Submission Countdown":** For Sprint projects, we show a "Days to Submission" counter to maintain momentum.

## 4. Reducing Your Load
- By funneling everything into Payload, you and Micah don't have to "catch up" on WhatsApp. You just look at the **Project Log** in Payload to see the last 5 things that happened.
