# 18: Payment & Correspondence Operations

This document addresses the specific operational concerns regarding the 25/75 split and the management of high-stakes correspondence with clients and publishers.

## 1. The "25/75" Principal Split: Resource Allocation

The business operates on a revenue-share model between the two Principals (Micah and You), designed to account for both business development and operational execution.

### The Breakdown
| Entity | Cut | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micah (Principal)** | **25%** | Strategy, Sales, High-Level Quality Control, and Client Relationship Management. |
| **You (Principal/Admin)** | **75%** | Operations, Technical Infrastructure, and **Production Costs** (Researcher Salaries/Freelance Fees). |

### Margin Management (Your 75%)
Since your 75% cut must cover the actual "work" (the researchers), your profit is the margin between your 75% and what you pay the team.
1.  **Production Target:** Aim for researcher costs to be **40-50%** of the total project value.
2.  **Net Profit:** This leaves you with a **25-35%** net profit after paying the team, matching Micah's take-home pay while accounting for the administrative load you carry.
3.  **Transaction Fees:** Processing fees (e.g., Stripe's 3% or Wise's transfer fees) should be deducted from the *Total Revenue* before the 25/75 split to ensure both principals share the cost of doing business.
    - *Example:* On a $1,000 project:
        - Total: $1,000
        - Fees (Stripe/Wise): -$30 (approx.)
        - Net Revenue: $970
        - **Micah (25%):** $242.50
        - **You (75%):** $727.50 (To pay researchers and keep the rest).

## 2. Correspondence Management: The "Buffer" Model

The goal is to make the client feel like they have a "Personal Office" while protecting Micah's time and ensuring the Researchers have the info they need.

### The "Press House" Workflow (Follow-ups)
When a client needs to speak to a publisher (e.g., CRC Press, Routledge) or vice versa:

1.  **The Authorization:** The client signs a simple "Limited Administrative Proxy," allowing the Agency to handle submission status and technical formatting queries on their behalf.
2.  **The Drafting (Researcher):** In the **Agency OS (Payload Dashboard)**, the researcher opens the **Correspondence** tab for that project and creates a new entry. They write the draft follow-up to the publisher.
3.  **The Triage Loop:**
    - **Status Change:** The researcher sets the status to `Pending Approval`.
    - **Notification:** Micah (Principal) receives a notification on his dashboard.
    - **The "Approve/Send" (Principal):** Micah reviews the draft, makes any "Agency Voice" tweaks, and clicks **Approve & Send**. The system then sends the email from the dedicated client alias (e.g., `dr.smith.office@white-label-agency.com`).
    - **Incoming:** When the publisher replies, the Agency OS **Global Triage** ingests it and links it back to the correspondence thread.

### Managing Simultaneous Submissions (Leverage Mode)
For **The Professional (Tier 3)** projects involving multiple presses:
- **Parallel Threads:** The Agency OS tracks separate correspondence threads for each Press (e.g., "Thread: Routledge," "Thread: CRC Press").
- **Leverage Notifications:** If Press A moves to "Interest," the system flags the Researcher to draft "Courtesy Update" emails for Press B and C. 
    - *Micah's Voice:* "Just a quick update that we've received an initial expression of interest from another house, but our client remains very interested in your press. Any update on your timeline?"
- **The Triage Board:** A consolidated view shows the status across all houses (e.g., Routledge: *Submitted*; CRC: *Reviewing*; Springer: *Interest*).

### Client vs. Company Correspondence
- **Clients NEVER speak to Researchers:** This protects our "White-Label" status and prevents researchers from "poaching" clients.
- **The "Agency Voice":** All emails sent to clients come from Micah or a generic "Project Management" address, even if they were drafted by a researcher.
- **Status Anxiety Management:** The Agency OS automatically sends "Status Updates" (e.g., "Manuscript is 60% through the Peer Review stage") to the client portal so they don't have to email Micah just to ask for an update.

## 4. The "Principal's Shield": Psychological & Ethical Protection

To protect Micah’s academic standing and ensure he remains a "High-Status Advocate" rather than a "Salesman," we must frame his 25% cut not as a referral fee, but as an **Executive Oversight & Quality Assurance Fee**.

### The Ethical Framing: "The Partner, Not the Middleman"
1.  **Transparency of Ownership:** We never hide that Micah is a Founding Principal. Clients are told: "This is Micah’s private agency team." People expect a founder to profit from their firm; they *distrust* a colleague taking a secret "kickback" for a referral.
2.  **The "Sponsorship" Model:** Micah’s 25% is tied to his role in **Project Strategy & Final Approval**. He is the "Executive Producer" of the project. If a client is unhappy, Micah is the final point of escalation. This makes his fee an insurance policy for the client, not a tax.
3.  **Operational Decoupling:** Micah never discusses money or invoices.
    - **The Script:** "I’ll have my Managing Principal (You) handle the logistics and the team—I stay focused on the high-level strategy and making sure the final product meets my personal standards."
    - **The Effect:** This preserves his "Academic Peer" status. You handle the "transactional" side, while Micah handles the "relationship" side.

### Protecting the Relationship (The "Buffer" in Action)
- **If a client asks about his cut:** "As a Principal of the firm, I oversee the strategy and quality control. My fee covers the final executive review to ensure your work meets the standard of the publishers I work with."
- **Mutual Protection:** By framing the 75% as "Production Costs & Team Salaries," we make it clear that the bulk of the money goes to the *work*. Micah’s 25% is the premium the client pays for his **Reputation and Oversight**.

### Conflict of Interest Management
- We avoid situations where Micah is the *only* person reviewing a colleague's work for an official university committee if they are a paying client. 
- **The Solution:** The Agency OS keeps a clear log of "Micah’s Peer Reviews" vs. "Agency Consulting." If a conflict exists, the Agency provides the service, but Micah recuses himself from the university-side decision, protecting his integrity.
