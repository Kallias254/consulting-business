# 11: Marketing & Automation Hub Integration

## The Conversion & Fulfillment Ecosystem
Our automation strategy moves from "Generic Outreach" to **"Precision Ingestion."** We bridge the gap between the public SMM Hub and our internal Consulting OS.

### 1. Ingestion: The Native Onboarding Portal
When a lead clicks "Request Audit" on your company site, it triggers a **Native Payload Form**.
- **Payload 3.0 Integration:** The data flows directly into the **Onboarding Queue** (Collection: `leads`). No third-party data handlers.
- **Immediate Value:** The system automatically notifies Micah: *"New High-Pain Lead from MIT: 48-page manuscript requires CRC formatting."*
- **Sovereign Comms:** A **Resend** automation (BYOK) immediately sends a "Confirmation & Next Steps" email using an elite university-style template.

### 2. Fulfillment Automation: The "Heartbeat" Logic
We use our **Dual-Audit Stream** to automate the "Feeling of Progress" for the client without manual emailing.

- **The Technical Trigger:** Every time a writer completes a "Manuscript Unit" (Chapter) and the Typst WASM engine renders a "Green Light" PDF.
- **The Emotional Automation:** The system (via a background task) triggers a **"Progress Pulse"** email to the client: *"Dr. Jones, your Chapter 1 is now typeset and entering Micah's final review. View your progress here [Link]."*
- **The Value:** The client feels "held" by the system, reducing their submission anxiety automatically.

### 3. Smart Triage Automation
- **AI-Led Ingestion:** Later, we will use AI to "chew" on the **Global Inbox**. It will recognize Micah's email address and the subject line "Revised Art," then suggest the **"Promote to Vault"** action automatically.
- **Bi-directional Sync:** Your "Sent Folder" monitoring ensures that when you send a file manually, the marketing site's "Project Status" bar updates in real-time.

### 4. Promotion: The "Typeset Teaser"
- **Action:** Use your SMM Hub to pump "Before & After" visuals.
- **Automated Workflow:** Take a raw Markdown snippet from the `leads` collection, run it through a "Teaser" Typst template, and email the resulting high-end PDF back to the prospect within 2 hours. This "Speed to Value" is what wins the contract.
