# 20: Email Scripts & Agency Voice - The "Micah" Standard

To maintain our elite positioning, all communications must feel like a **peer-to-peer scholarly consultation**, not a marketing funnel. We avoid "Marketing Buttons" and "Sales Language." We use clean, serif typography and high-density information.

## 1. The Voice Guidelines
- **The Tone:** Authoritative yet supportive. A "Senior Faculty" mentor.
- **The Format:** Plain-text or minimal HTML. No banners, no large logos, no "Buy Now" buttons.
- **The Signature:** Always "Micah [Lastname], Executive Principal" or "The [Agency Name] Team."
